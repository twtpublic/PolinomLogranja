# PolinomLogranja
Realization of the Lagrange polynomial. The Delphi development environment is used. In this code, there are small glitches, but in general the program works, the input of coordinates by Y is entered from the file.

The program is implemented as follows: The program reads the Y coordinates from the file. Coordinates X are stretched from the general form of "Image". On the form there are only 2 buttons, the build button and the button for closing the program.

This is my first program, which I distribute, I hope for understanding on your part, maybe I do not have competent coding. If there are any comments or suggestions, you can write to me, I will gladly accept comments.
Proposals for the improvement of the program are accepted at: recor65@protonmail.ch
